The AWFixer and Friends Account is a vital part of the experience using AWFixer and Friends products and is designed to be that way.

The Account is the central point of truth for you accross all of the AWFixer and Friends Services. As with all of the things that we build it will be constructed to be aethsetically pleasing and very easy to use.

The Account will only be accessible via the AWID App, there will be no passwords, no emails and your username will be unable to allow you to authenticate without the AWID App.

<Info>
    if you lose access to your AWID App there will be ways to restore your access to the service via information that you provide when you create your account. This access will be manually restored as we want to ensure that AI and Spoofing is not used to access our users accounts.
